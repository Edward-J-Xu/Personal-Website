      My name is Edward Xu, I am currently a student at Lone Star college attempting to get my <strong>AAS</strong><em>(Associate Of Science)</em> in mobile/web development.
        I am trying to learn faster than my school is teaching me currently. I Am hoping that this course will teach me what I need to know a little faster and depending on how i feel in the next few months
        I may leave college temporaraly to attend a web development Bootcamp. Hopefully one day I can get a great job developing some of the worlds best websites either remotely or in a comfortable work space.-->

          <h3 class="learner-title">Good Learner</h3>
          <p class="learner-text-description">Extensive analytical and technical skills in computer software and hardware.
<br>Self-motived, strong communication skill, excellent time management skill.
<br>I am able to take on a task I don't know much about and with some time and a few resources, I am able to complete the task. For example, I used to build gameboy and write games for fun, I started with
          nothing but a Arduino and some components to add on to it. Using the Resources I had avliable (i.e Google, Youtube) I quickly finished the product that contains pong and snake within a few months
